In this guide we present the developers instructions for the Unified-Planning library.

Code formatting
===============

We decided to use `black <https://black.readthedocs.io>` to automatically check and format
the code according to a predefined code style.

For maintaining code formatting and styling, instead of humans correcting the linting mistakes,
we use `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`. After installing it, execute `pre-commit install`:
this will install git hooks in .git/ directory of the project.
Then, wWhen you commit staged Python files, before committing pre-commit hooks are executed and
black checks the code formatting. If every check passes, the commit is made else, code
is automatically formatted and sent back for review.
