The UPF library makes it easy to formulate planning problems and to invoke automated planners.

* Define problems in a *simple*, *intuitive*, and *planner independent* way
* Solve your planning problems using one of the native solvers, or by using any PDDL planner
* Dump your problems in PDDL (or  ANML) format
* Parse PDDL problem formulations
* Simplification, grounding, removal of conditional effects and many other transformations are available
* and more...
