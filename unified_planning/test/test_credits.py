Pyperplan is a lightweight STRIPS planner written in Python.
Please note that Pyperplan deliberately prefers clean code over fast code. It is designed to be used as a teaching or prototyping tool. If you use it for paper experiments, please state clearly that Pyperplan does not offer state-of-the-art performance.
It was developed during the planning practical course at Albert-Ludwigs-Universit채t Freiburg during the winter term 2010/2011 and is published under the terms of the GNU General Public License 3 (GPLv3).
Pyperplan supports the following PDDL fragment: STRIPS without action costs.

License: Apache 2.0
UP sequential validator, does sequential plan validation by creating a state from the problem initial state.
After that the validator tries to apply the action instances of the given plan.
If the every action instance is applicable in the reached state and after the sequential applications of all the actions, the goals is reached, the plan is considered valid. Otherwise the plan is invalid and the unsatisfied condition is reported to the user as an ERROR level LogMessage.

This grounder, does basic simplification and removes impossible actions and actions with different assignment to the same variable. It implements the naive grounding algorithm for classical, numeric and temporal planning

ENHSP is a forward heuristic search planner, but it is expressive in that it can handle:
 - Classical Planning
 - Numeric Planning with linear and non-linear (!!) expressions
 - Planning with discretised autonomous processes and events
 - Global constraints, which are the analogous of always constraints of PDDL.
